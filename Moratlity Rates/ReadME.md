---

## 📌 Report Snapshot

A quick overview of the dashboard and findings:

- **Global Avg. Death Rate:** 7,063 per 100,000  
- **Total Deaths (1970–2010):** 948M+  
- **Trends:** Mortality rates declined, but absolute deaths increased due to population growth  
- **Top Contributors:** India, China, USA, Russia, Germany, Nigeria  
- **Gender:** Men consistently had higher mortality than women  
- **Age Groups:** Elderly (80+ years) most affected, but infant and child mortality remained high

## 🟠 Problem

Mortality data is critical for public health planning, but large datasets can be overwhelming to interpret.  

I set out to answer:  
- How have global mortality rates changed over time?  
- Which countries, genders, and age groups are most affected?  
- What patterns can guide future health strategies?

## 🔵 Methodology

**Data Preparation:**  
- Cleaned and validated mortality data (1970–2010) using Excel and SQL.  

**Analysis:**  
- Segmented data by country, gender, and age group.  
- Calculated deaths per 100,000 people for fair comparison.  

**Visualization (Tableau):**  
- Built interactive dashboards with:  
  - **Time trends** → Mortality rates vs number of deaths.  
  - **Maps** → Country-level mortality differences.  
  - **Gender comparisons** → Male vs Female trends.  
  - **Age distributions** → Impact of mortality across cohorts.  

**Communication:**  
- Simplified findings into plain-language insights for both technical and non-technical audiences.

## 🟢 Key Findings

- **Global Trend:** Average death rate = **7,063 per 100,000**; **948M+ deaths** over 40 years.  
- **Rates Down, Deaths Up:** Mortality rates declined (due to healthcare improvements), but **total deaths rose** because of population growth.  
- **Country Differences:** India, China, USA, Russia, Germany, and Nigeria were the largest contributors.  
- **Gender:** Men consistently had **higher mortality rates** than women.  
- **Age Groups:** Elderly (80+ years) had the highest mortality, while **infant and child mortality** remained high in many regions.
