Problem Statement

Despite Nairobi’s status as a major urban hub, significant disparities exist in healthcare accessibility across its sub-counties. Key challenges include:

Uneven Distribution: Some sub-counties are underserved, especially high-density areas like Embakasi.

Reliance on Private Sector: 68% of healthcare facilities are privately owned, creating financial barriers for low-income populations.

Limited After-Hours Care: Only 24 facilities (22 private, 2 public) operate 24/7, leaving major gaps in emergency coverage.

The goal of this project was to analyze healthcare accessibility in Nairobi and provide data-driven recommendations for improving equity, affordability, and emergency preparedness.

Methodology

The analysis was carried out using an interactive Power BI dashboard built from Nairobi healthcare facility data. Steps included:

Data Loading & Cleaning – Standardized facility information, ownership, and operational status.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Distribution of facilities by sub-county.

Ownership (public vs private).

Facility types (clinics, dispensaries, maternity, etc.).

Operational hours (weekend and 24/7).

Geo-mapping for spatial patterns.

Calculated Metrics:

Facility-to-population ratios.

% distribution of public vs private facilities.

Coverage gaps by population density.

Visualization:

Maps for geographic distribution.

Bar and pie charts for ownership and operational hours.

KPI cards for total facilities, total population, and density.

Key Findings

County-Wide Insights

Total facilities: 940 serving 4M people.

Average population density: 17,560/km².

Ownership: 68% private, 32% public.

Only 105 facilities open on weekends and 24 facilities open 24/7.

Medical clinics dominate (459), while specialized facilities (maternity/nursing homes) are limited.

Sub-County Highlights

Embakasi: Largest population (989k) but only 151 facilities → most underserved (~1 facility per 6,550 people).

Kasarani: 192 facilities for 781k people, but 82% are private.

Starehe: Strong ratio (137 facilities for 210k people), but only 10 open 24/7.

Kibra: More public than private facilities (54 vs 30) → better affordability for residents.

Proposed Solutions

Strategic Public Investment: Expand public facilities in underserved, high-density sub-counties (Embakasi, Kamukunji).

Incentivize Extended Hours: Grants/tax benefits to encourage both public and private facilities to operate on weekends and 24/7.

Targeted Infrastructure Development: Build more specialized facilities (maternity, nursing homes).

Community-Based Programs: Deploy mobile clinics and outreach services where physical facilities are limited.

Impact & Results (if implemented)

Improved Health Outcomes: Faster diagnoses and treatment → reduced morbidity & mortality.

Equitable Access: A more balanced public-private distribution ensures affordability.

Reduced Strain on Emergency Services: More 24/7 facilities relieve hospital ERs of non-critical cases.

Enhanced Resilience: Nairobi better prepared for public health crises through distributed facilities.

Personal Contribution

I designed the dashboard, conducted the analysis, and synthesized insights into policy-oriented recommendations. This project demonstrates how data visualization can bridge the gap between healthcare data and public health planning.

It aligns directly with UN Sustainable Development Goal 3 (Good Health and Well-being), particularly:

Target 3.8: Achieve universal health coverage.

Target 3.c: Strengthen the health workforce and health financing in underserved areas.
