# Sports Program Analysis and Visualization
## Project Overview

This project aims to provide insights into sports program participation, revenue generation, and institutional trends using visual analysis. By leveraging interactive visualizations, we explore patterns and disparities in sports programs across different institutions and demographics, allowing stakeholders to make data-driven decisions for improved funding and participation equity.

## Objectives

Analyze participation and revenue trends across various sports programs.

Compare and contrast male and female participation rates.

Identify top-performing sports in terms of revenue and highlight any disparities.

Visualize key insights to support data-driven recommendations.

## Data Collection
The data for this project was sourced from Kaggle, including datasets on sports participation, revenue, and demographics for various institutions. Key features include NCAA classification, enrollment numbers, gender participation metrics, and institutional location, enabling a comprehensive look at factors affecting sports program funding and participation.

## Analysis and Visualization

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Data Overview:

  - Initial exploration included assessing data distribution, missing values, and key metrics.

   - Trends in Revenue: Analyzed revenue trends over multiple years to evaluate stability and growth patterns.
  - Top Revenue-Generating Sports: Identified sports that generate the most revenue, along with their corresponding expenditures.
   - Participation by Gender: Compared male and female participation rates across various sports to identify any gaps and trends.
### Visualization:

- Revenue Trends: Line charts displaying revenue fluctuations over the years, highlighting stability or growth.
- Top Sports by Revenue and Expenditure: Bar plots comparing revenue and expenditure for the top sports, providing insights into which sports bring in the most funding and require higher expenses.
- Gender Participation: 
   - Sports Participation by Gender: Stacked bar charts to show differences in male and female participation rates across sports.
   - Disparities in Revenue and Expenses: Heatmaps indicating revenue and expenses for men’s and women’s sports, offering a clear view of funding gaps.
- Institutional Factors:
    - Classification and Participation: Visualizations showing how institutional classifications (e.g., NCAA divisions) impact participation rates and revenue.
- Regional Analysis: Geographical maps showing distribution of revenue and participation rates across regions, illustrating regional disparities.
### Insights from Analysis:

- Revenue Stability: Found that revenue has remained relatively stable over the years, suggesting a mature market with limited growth unless new initiatives are introduced.
- Top-Performing Sports: Football, Basketball, and Baseball emerged as top revenue generators, typically correlating with higher expenditures.
- Gender Disparities: Notable differences were observed in participation and revenue between men’s and women’s sports, with male-dominated sports generating more revenue.
- Institutional Classification Impact: NCAA classification was a significant factor, with higher divisions generally showing more participation and funding.
## Tools and Libraries
- Data Analysis: Pandas, NumPy
- Visualization: Power BI for dashboards; Matplotlib, Seaborn for detailed data visualizations in Python
### Conclusion
This analysis highlights critical trends and disparities in sports program funding and participation, allowing institutions to strategically plan resource allocation. By focusing on high-performing sports, promoting gender equity, and considering institutional classifications,
educational institutions can enhance both participation and revenue generation in sports programs.
